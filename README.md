# TRIVIA API PROJECT - Udacity's Nanodegree Project

This fullstack trivia app is one of Udacity's invested projects developed to create bonding experiences for its employees and students. The idea is to hold trivia questions on regular basis to test the knowledge of these employees and students. As part of the Fullstack Nanodegree from Udacity, it served as a practice module to test students knowledge and skill in API Development and Documentation. The application is able to:

* Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
* Delete questions.
* Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
* Search for questions based on a text query string.
* Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

> **Note** - The API Reference for the application is also found below this file. 

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

#### Setting up the Backend

#### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.10** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - Virtual envrionements are recommended whenever python is being used for projects. This keeps your dependecies separate and organized for each project. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

#### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `trivia` database:

```bash
createbd trivia
```

Populate the database using the `trivia.psql` file provided. From the `backend` folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

#### Run the Server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_DEBUG=True
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

#### Setting up the frontend

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with [Flask-based Backend](../backend) so it will not load successfully if the backend is not working or not connected. We recommend that you **stand up the backend first**, test using Postman or curl, update the endpoints in the frontend, and then the frontend should integrate smoothly.

#### Installing Dependencies

1. **Installing Node and NPM**
   This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. **Installing project dependencies**
   This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

> _tip_: `npm i`is shorthand for `npm install``

#### Required Tasks

#### Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use `npm start`. You can change the script in the `package.json` file.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

```bash
npm start
```

### Tests

In order to run tests, navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands:

```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>

# API Reference

### Getting Started

* Base URL: At present this application can only be run locally as it is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` , which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. The frontend is hosted at its default `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.
* Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    'success': False,
    'error': 405,
    'message': 'method not allowed'
}
```

The API returns four error types when requests fail. They are:
* 400: Bad Request
* 404: Resource Not Found
* 405: Method Not Allowed
* 422: Not Processable

### Endpoints

#### GET /categories

* This endpoint returns dictionary of all the categories available in the trivia game, a success value, and a total number of categories.
* Sample: `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/categories`

```
{
  "categories": {
    "1": "Science",
    "2": "Art",
    "3": "Geography",
    "4": "History",
    "5": "Entertainment",
    "6": "Sports"
  },
  "success": true,
  "total_categories": 6
}
```

#### GET /questions

* Returns all the questions stored in the app's database.
* Results are paginated in groups of 10. You can include a request argument to choose a specific page number, starting from 1.
* Sample: `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/questions`

```
